# TODO

Things to be done for next milestone.  
Each thing on the checklist needs to be implemented fully, from lexer to parser to Bytecode and VM execution.  
e.g.: integers need to be parsed converted, put in to a chunk and executed.  

## Should be done to reach next version

V 0.0.1:

- [ ] add base types `interger` and `float`
- [ ] add operations `+ - * /`

## Should be done at some point

- [ ] output artifacts from docker build
